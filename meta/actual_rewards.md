# List of the actual rewards
I thought that the rewards will only be calcule at the point of view of the environment. This is true for the most of them but how will I be able to calculate the rewards that compare differents trajectories.
So from now, there will be rewards from the environment and rewards from the population. 
The rewards from the environment are the one calculate in a independant way and the population ones are dependants.
