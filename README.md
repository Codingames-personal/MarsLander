# MarsLander
Create a trajectory to have a successful landing by using a genetic algorithm

## Somes words
I am actually writting an article on this project. It is based on the article __[A dedicated landing with genetic algorithm](https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/)__ by Vlado. Thanks to him I succeded to make my first step in GA and can tried somes ideas that stayed in my heads during this past week.  

## Using it

The script main have obviously the main code but if you want to visualize the trajectory you can use env_pygame to see every trajectorys at every evolution of the population. 

On the script env_pygame, there is somes exemples of surface such as the cave and the reverse cave.


## Meta

On the meta file you will find upgrades ideas that have already been implemented or not and an actual rewards file that explains the repartition of the calculated score.
